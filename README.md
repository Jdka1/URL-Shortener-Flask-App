# URL shortener flask website

To use run main.py and input links at localhost:5000. Access them to be redirected at localhost:5000/*shortlink* where *shortlink* is the shortener given.
For each link inputted, its checked if it is malformed through the validators python module, and if it is it cannot be inputted.
Key value pairs cannot be replaced when setting links so original shortened urls are presereved.
